# AlamedaFoodBankTicketSystem

The Alameda Food Bank Ticketing System is a web application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete tickets for managing appointments or visitors at the Alameda Food Bank. The system consists of a backend built using Node.js and Express, which interacts with an SQLite database to store and manage ticket data. On the frontend side, a React application communicates with the backend through HTTP requests to manage the tickets.
